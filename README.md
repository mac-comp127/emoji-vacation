Comp 124: Emoji Family Vacation Lab
====

Your emojis are going on vacation!

Overview
---

You start this lab with an existing project, which gives you some nice building blocks for creating landscapes. You will fill out the landscapes, then put your emojis in it.



Tasks they should definitely do:

- Copy their favorite emojis into this project
- Make them repositionable (and resizable?)
- Implement createVacation with variable adults and children (looping, tricky b/c they have to rectify x positions across two loops)
- Make createVacation randomly select different emojis (conditional)

Tasks we might ask them to do just a few of; the rest weâ€™d provide for them:

- Implement createForest using existing createTree (loops)
- Implement createMountains using existing createLayerOfMountains (loops, counting down, slightly trickier coord math)
- Have forests and mountains only sometimes using the percentChance helper (conditionals)
- Do the slide show while loop (they'll need hints on removeAll and pause)

Tasks that are probably optional challenges:

- Add buildings or other new scenery
- Make different times of day (but moon is hard to draw with comp124graphics)
- Instead of looping over adults and then chidlren, make the eomji family members not always be lined up in the same order. (Doing this with only while loops and no collections makes for a fun little challenge.)
